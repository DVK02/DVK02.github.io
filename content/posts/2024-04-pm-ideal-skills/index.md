## Foreword

This is a compilation of characteristics I've come across that are provided by product leaders. It is moreso review material for myself than a guide for others. Therefore, the material is more relevant for entry level product managers with 0-3 years of experience.

The ability to assess a situation and making the right decision based on that assessment. The idea to work smarter and more efficiently.

## Execution

### Starting A New Job

- For the first 90 days, observe, get familiar with new surroundings; products, leadership, team goals.

### Figuring Out What To Do

- Ask your boss what you need to work on.

OR

- What does your boss care about most?
- Who needs my output to be effective?
- How can I help them get what they need done?
- What unique strengths and superpowers can I share?

### Using System 1 And System 2 To Get Stuff Done

- System 1 is reactive thinking.
    - We use system 1 for things we don't need to think about because we've done it before.
- System 2 is thoughtful thinking.
    - System 2 is when we take the time to think about something.
    - Creative thinking to innovate new features vs. copying the competition.
    - Analytical thinking to analyze customer data vs. delegating to another team.
    - Logical thinking to influence a course of action vs. bullying / shaming / intimidating to get action.
    - Empathetic thinking to explain why we missed our goals vs. blaming or making excuses.

- It is important to identify which situations require System 2 thinking, and also to catch ourselves defaulting to System 1 when we should be using System 2.
- If you struggle to use System 2, then force yourself to write.
- Do System 2 tasks earlier in the day while the brain is still fresh, as System 2 tasks require deep thinking.

### Just Do It (and Update)

- Having to be reminded what to do is annoying for managers.
- Be proactive in doing and updating.
- Benefits of praoctively updating:
    - Reduce anxiety and fear, build trust, and lessen workload amongst team and stakeholders.
- Trust is the foundation of good relationships.

### The Importance Of Visibility

- No one knows what you've accomplished or are working on unless you tell them.
    - If you don't tell them, then they will imagine the worst.
- Do not worry about overcommunication; the worst outcome is you get told to update less, much better than the alternative of undercommunicating.

### Follow Chain Of Command

- Always inform your boss when you intend to operate around them.
- If someone asks you to do something, including those superior to your boss, don't automatically say yes.
    - Inform your boss first and ask for permission.
