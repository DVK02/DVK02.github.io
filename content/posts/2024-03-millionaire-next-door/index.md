## Introduction

This isn't a complete summary of the book "The Millionaire Next Door", rather a collection of key points I find interesting.

## Realized and Unrealized Income

> To build wealth, minimize your realized (taxable) income and maximize your unrealized income (wealth/capital appreciation without a cash flow).

- Income tax is tax on income, but not wealth or its appreciation, under the condition that the appreciation of wealth does not generate cash flow.
- Often people tend to maximize their realized income to support high-consumption lifestyles.

### Case Study: Sharon

- Sharon's realized income is $220,000 and her net worth is $370,00. 
    - Last year she paid $69,440 in federal tax, which is equivalent to 18.8% of her total wealth.
    - The average person in the same age and income category pays 6.2% of their total wealth in tax, which would mean the expected total wealth for Sharon is $1,122,000.
    - Most of Sharon's financial assets are in liquid form, when they should instead be invested in appreciating assets that do not generate cash flow.

### Case Study: Perot

- Perot's realized income is $230 million and his net worth is $2.4 billion.
    - Last year he paid $19.5 million in tax, which is equivalent to 0.8% of his total wealth.
    - His income tax rate is only 8.5%, compared to the average american income tax rate of 12.9%.
    - Perot minimizes his tax bill by investing heavily in tax-free municiples, tax-sheltered real estate, and stocks with unrealized gains.

## Mortgage Rule of Thumb

> If you're not yet wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your household's total annual realized income.

(The age of this book really shows with this rule.)
