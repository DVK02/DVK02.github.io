# Resumes

## The 15 Second Rule

- A resume screener will glace at resume for about 15 seconds.

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Shorter is Better

- Stick to the highlights, keep out what isn't important.
- Less than 4 years of experience, keep to one page. Over 4 can go 1-2 pages.

### Rule 2: Bullet, Not Blobs

- Easier to read.
- Keep each bullet to less than three lines.
- No more than 50% of bullets should be be over 1 line.
- Edit lines that briefly overflow to next line as they are a waste of space.

### Rule 3: Accomplishments, Not Responsibilities

- Examples
    - Responsibility Oriented: Design features for Amazon S3 and oversee development of the features across software engineers and testers.
    - Accomplishment Oriented: Designed the SS Frontline feature, managed its development, and led its integration across three products, leading to an additional $10 million in revenue.
- Use past tense to better convey an accomplishment rather responsibility.
- Focus on the impact; "what" more so than the "how" (both are important though).
    - How much money did you make for your company? 
    - How much time did you save your team? 
    - By how much did you improve customer retention?
- If you have an existing resume, it might help to start from scratch with these questions in mind:
    - What are the five things you are most proud of?
    - What would your team say are the five most important things you did?

### Rule 4: Use a Good Template

- Don't use one with lots of graphics.
- A good template clearly showcases your highlight.

### Rule 5: Don't Skip the Best Stuff

- Don't leave something out for a reason you think is "appropriate".
    - Example: Starting a game development company, hired multiple engineers and designers, and overseen development of a game - BUT did not include this point becaues it hadn't launched a game yet.
- In short, an experience should not be excluded because it wasn't "done".
- Other bad reasons include:
    - "It was for class"
    - "We didn't get many downloads"

## Attributes of a Good PM Resume

- Showcase technical skills, love technology, have initiative, are leaders, and will make an impact.
- Passion for Technology:
    - Experiences in tech and side projects.
- Initiative:
    - Show initiative through a university club, new employee training program at a startup.
- Leadership:
    - Managing an intern.
- Impact:
    - Show positive impact in prior roles - highlight personal contributions rather than the team's.
    - Explicitly state what you've built, created, led, or implemented.
    - Avoid weak phrases such as "worked with" and "helped with".
- Tech Skills:
    - List programming languages in a "technical skils" section.
    - Ideally will also have specific projects to list.

## What to Include

This section lists common components found in resumes and rates their importance.

Do not include every bullet here!!! 

- Objectives: Never useful.
    - Almost always a waste of space - everything put here can be inferred by the resume and the act of submitting the resume.
- Summary: Rarely useful.
    - A good resume conveys this information already.
- Skills: Include if applicable.
    - Include technical skills / proficiency with software design.
- Awards: Include.
    - Make award meaningful; How select is it? What did you do to win it?
- Activities: Sometimes include.
    - Personally, I do not like this so exclude it. - Dan
- Projects: Include.
    - Probably 2nd most important resume item.
    - Describe what the project is that you built and what metrics of success you have.
- Website URL: Include.
    - Website should provide your resume, as well as additional details about your projects (such as screenshots).
- Education: Depends based on how long ago you graduated.
    - Substantial Leadership Positions, emphasis on substantial.

Work experience and projects go at the top. Skills and education at the bottom.
