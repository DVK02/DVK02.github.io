## What is a PM?

- PM is responsible for making sure that a team ships a great product.
- Lead without authority, influence with vision and research.
- Sit at the intersection of tech, business, and design.
  - Wear many hats and learn multiple points of view.
- Advocate for the customer.
  - Learn and translate their needs into product goals and features.
- A PM knows when the utilize teams of different function, and fill in when needed.

## Functions of a PM

- Involved in all phases of a product life cycle:
  - Research & Planning -> Design -> Implement & Test -> Release
  - a PM usually focuses on R&P, while TPM focuses on D, I&T.

### Research & Planning

- Deciding what to build next based on customer request, competitive analysis, new technology, user research, the sales or marketing teams, brainstorming, or the big vision for the product.
- Next, create or propose a roadmap.
  - Talk to all sources to create a large list of potential features or development work.
  - Then filter and prioritize based on customer needs, competitive landscape, business needs, and team's expertise.
  - Start defining what success looks like, typically using the OKR model.

### Design

- Features and functionality of the product.
- On some teams, a PM will write a specifications (to be reviewed by others) that includes:
  - Goals, use cases, requirements, wireframes, bullet point describing every possible state of the feature, internationalization, security
- Otherwise, the process will be looser with more rapid design.
  - Work with a designer and iterate, talking about goals and features, then sending to engineers to review.
- Interview Question: Ask who you'll be working with on core and extended teams. How much time working on specs and how much time working with designers.

### Implement and Test

- During the implementation stage, keep track of how the project is going.
  - Sometimes there are blockages in workflow - try and resolve these.
  - If task is behind schedule, try to cut lower priority work.
- Qualitative Feedback
  - "Dogfooding" is the idea of using one's own product.
  - Conduct usability studies (usually in smaller companies)
- Quantitative Feedback
  - Acquired via running experiments, where a percentage of users are expose to the new feature (experiment group) and the rest are not (control group).
  - Compare success metrics between user and control groups.
  
### Release

- Ensure launch goes smoothly.
- Launch checklist (varies team to team):
  - Final approvals, team who will support product are prepared, prepare for all things that could go wrong.
