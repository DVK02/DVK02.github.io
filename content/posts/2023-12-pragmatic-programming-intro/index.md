## Introduction

> "_An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest._" - Benjamin Franklin

The first book in my book summary series will be [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://amzn.to/48ueL4S) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. I aim to cover each chapter by summarizing any takeaways I find interesting or useful. My personal opinion is that these concepts will become increasingly more valuable as AI assisted programming becomes standard practice. The factors that differentiate the skill of programmers, particularly in early career roles, will likely weigh more heavily on their effectiveness and productivity rather than basic syntax and language familiarity.

The purpose of this book is to help you become a better programmer, regardless of your technical experience, with a focus on practical application over theoretical. It speaks to the importance of being able to provide solutions from understanding basic principles of computer science, rather than relying on any specific tools.

## Characteristics of a Pragmatic Programmer

At a high level, a pragmatic programmer will exhibit these qualities:

- **Early adopter/fast adapter**
  - Quick to learn and eager to try new things.
- **Inquisitive**
  - Asks questions, down to the nitty gritty.
- **Critical Thinker**
  - Challenges reasonings and "facts" from others.
- **Realistic**
  - Understands the underlying problem and determines length and difficulty of a task accordingly .
- **Jack of all Trades**
  - Most jobs will require a specialist, but should maintain familiarity with other technologies and environments.

## It's a Continuous Process

- "Kaizen" is a Japanese term that when simplified, is a concept that refers to continuously making small improvements.
  - **Dan's Opinion:** I'm sure this concept is less revolutionary nowadays, especially with the soaring popularity of self-help books like atomic habits that go into detail about these ideas.

## The Cat Ate My Source Code

> "_The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak._" - J.B. Bossuet, _Politics from Holy Writ_, 1709

- When accepting responsibility, you accept being held accountable to its outcome.
- Take responsibility for yourself and your actions in terms of your day-to-day works all the way to career progression.
- Things go wrong. It is important to learn how to deal with these things professionally.

## Software Entropy

- The "Broken Window Theory" explains that a single broken window increases the likelihood of an entire neighborhood ending up tattered and destroyed.
  - **Dan's Opinion:** This lines up with "clean your room" and "tidy your workspace" having a bigger impact on our lives (though I disagree with the second saying).
- If you don't have time to clean up, don't assume someone else will.
- As a challenge, point out two to three "broken windows" to your colleagues and discuss what the problems are and possible actions to fix them.

## Easier to Ask Forgiveness...

> "... than it is to get permission" - Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper

- When you are completely set on an idea, figure out what you can reasonably ask for to get it done, and do it well. Show others. Tell them how it could be improved.
- It is easier to join an ongoing success.

## Good-Enough Software

- The definition of "good enough software" is such that the software is good enough for _users_, eventual maintainers, and your own peace of mind.
- Specifically, a good enough software should meet its user's requirements. So be sure to give users an opportunity to try and determine whether it is good enough (if possible).
- The expected quality of the product should be defined in the requirements collected from the user at the beginning.
- It is also important to know when to stop working on a program or a specific feature. There is such a thing as over-refinement. Put your time to higher value projects.

## Your Knowledge Portfolio

- Your knowledge and experience are your most valuable assets.
- Managing a knowledge portfolio is similar to a financial portfolio:
	1) Invest regularly - as a habit.
		- Pretty straight forward, the most important factor is to make investing in your knowledge portfolio a habit.
	2) Diversification is key to long-term success.
		- The more technologies you know, the better you can handle change.
	3) Balance between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.
		- Some technology might be the next hot thing or it can collapse suddenly, while investing in "conservative" technology could lead to missed opportunities.
	4) Try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
		- Learning emerging tech before it becomes popular.
	5) Review and rebalance portfolios periodically.
		- Maybe some of your knowledge is obsolete, maybe some of it is not up to par.

## Knowledge Portfolio Goals

- **Learn at least one new language every year.**
	- Different languages solve the same problem in different ways. It helps broaden your thinking.
- **Read a technical book each quarter.**
	- Preferably something related to a current project. Once you become a master of that project, explore technical books related to other projects.
- **Read non technical books, too.**
	- Computers and programs are used by people - don't forget the human side of the equation.
- **Take classes.**
	- Look for interesting courses at local universities or colleges.
- **Participate in local user groups.**
	- Be an active participant in any local user groups, the networking is also important for your career.
- **Experiment with different environments.**
	- If you mainly work with Windows, try Linux (for example). If you only use makefiles and an editor, try and IDE, and vice versa.
- **Stay current.**
	- Subscribe to tech blogs.
- **Get wired.**
	- Similar to staying current.

The key is to continue investing. If you become comfortable with something you sought to learn, find something new. This process will open your mind to different ways of doing things, even in projects that aren't immediately related to what you learned.

**Dan's opinion**: The knowledge goals I am setting for myself this year are as follows:
- **New language**: Rust
- **Technical book**: The Pragmatic Programmer
- **Non-technical book**: Dune
- **Take classes**: I will likely opt to follow online courses available for free, related to low level programming
- **Local user group**: TBD
- **Different environment**: Installed Arch Linux on my Windows machine (after multiple tries)
- **Staying current**: TBD

## Opportunities for Learning

- If somebody asks you a question that you do not know the answer to, use it as an opportunity to learn. If you can't find out yourself, then ask someone who might, and if you don't know someone who might, then it would be wise to add that person to your network.
- Keep some reading material ready at all times in case there is some free time in your day, such as during a commute or waiting at a doctor's office.

## Critical Thinking

- Think critically about what you read and hear.
- Do not let your knowledge portfolio be effected by media hype. Keep in mind that top search results can be a matter of content providers paying to be placed there.

## Communicate!

> I believe that it is better to be looked over than it is to be overlooked. - Mae West, Belle of the Nineties, 1934

- Having the best ideas and code is useless without being able to communicate with other people.
- Communication is a large part of the job; team meetings, client meetings, one on ones, etc.
- Technically speaking, we communicate with machines through code.
- Therefore we need to make sure we communicate effectively.
- Know what you want to say.
	- Write down what you want to say and ask if it gets across the point you are trying to make.
	- This approach is applicable for writing documents, important meetings and calls, etc.
	- Jot down ideas you want to communicate and plan a couple strategies for getting them across.
- Know your audience.
	- Understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience.
	- Pitch your idea with context pertaining to the interests of specific demographic of your audience.
- Make what you're saying relevant in time and in content.
- Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience.
- Make it look good using style sheets or layout systems.
- Involve your audience by having them read an early draft and getting feedback.
- Be a listener, encourage people to talk by asking questions or have them summarize what you tell them.
- Get back to people, at the very least with a simple "I'll get back to you later".

## Tips

The authors continue to provide basic characteristics of pragmatic programmers in the form of tips.

- **Tip 1**: Care about your craft. Continue to try and improve your work.
- **Tip 2**: Think about what you are working on as you work on it. Every decision requires critical appraisal.
- **Tip 3**: Provide options instead of excuses. When something doesn't work, explain what _can_ be done to fix the problem. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- **Tip 4**: Don't live with broken windows; in our context, fix bad designs and poor code as soon as possible. If it is not possible to entirely fix the issue, take _some_ action to prevent further damage.
- **Tip 5**: Be a catalyst for change.
- **Tip 6**: Remember the big picture. Review what's happening around you and not just on yourself.
- **Tip 7**: Make quality a requirements issue. There will be trade-offs made, so let the users help guide you to a version of the product that is good enough.
- **Tip 8**: Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio.
- **Tip 9**: Critically analyze what you read and hear.
- **Tip 10**: It's both what you say and the way you say it.

### Dan's Note to Self

This is my first ever blog post. I think for a book summary the best method is to keep bullet points so it is easy to review at a glance. However, it definitely went on too long. So for future chapters I will split them up into multiple parts if necessary. I stopped paraphrasing as much towards the end as I just wanted to get it over with.
