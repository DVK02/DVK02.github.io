# Site Under Construction!!!

I’ve been building and shipping products across multiple roles and industries, from video streaming applications to API platforms. As a product person, my main goal is to understand my users and their specific needs, in order to deliver a product that truly improves their lives.

I’ve worked for several years in big companies and recently decided to trade that for the opportunity of working in smaller teams. Definitely prefer the latter where one can succeed/fail faster, learn faster, and overall have a way bigger impact.
