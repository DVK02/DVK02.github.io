# Introduction

Hello there. I'm Dan, and my technical interests revolve around computer science and product management. My educational background is a Bachelor's of Science from the University of Toronto, specializing in Computer Science. In addition to my CS background, I eventually discovered a passion for product management and user experience. 

During my first internship at a mobile game startup, I started off as a software engineer. I was writing high-performance, scalable code for mobile devices and making improvements to developer operations. My natural curiosity and desire to contribute led me to explore the product side of the business, so I started paying attention to common KPIs and more granular, player-level data. I eventually took ownership of several games, making data-driven decisions to improve KPIs. I was discovering and defining problems, considering why those problems are worth solving, hypothesizing solutions, and finally handling the technical implementations of those solutions. 

 I want to leverage my knowledge of software engineering to be a better product manager, and vice versa. This is because I love tackling all sorts of problems, and the colleagues I admire the most have been the ones that learn to solve problems outside of their primary realm of expertise. My end goal is to be the ultimate contributor to any team and project I am a part of.

# My Knowledge Goals

1. Write concepts in my own words.
2. Store knowledge.
