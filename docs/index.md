### Brief Introduction

Hello there. I'm Dan, and welcome to my blog. The purpose of this blog is to facilitate my never-ending curiosity and desire to learn. The primary topics will be about computer science and product management. There will be a sprinkle of UI/UX theory, as I am not particularly interested in making designs, rather the principles of good design. Please check out my [About](https://dvk02.github.io/about/) page to learn more about me and my [Projects](https://dvk02.github.io/projects/)page to check out some of my work.
