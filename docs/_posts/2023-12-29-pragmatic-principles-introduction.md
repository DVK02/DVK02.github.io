## Introduction

> "_An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest._" - Benjamin Franklin

The first book in my book review series will be [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://a.co/d/95qdIoI) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. I aim to cover each chapter by summarizing any takeaways I find interesting or useful. My personal opinion is that these concepts will become increasingly more valuable as AI assisted programming becomes standard practice. The factors that differentiate the skill of programmers, particularly in early career roles, will likely weigh more heavily on their effectiveness and productivity rather than basic syntax and language familiarity.

The purpose of this book is to help you become a better programmer, regardless of your technical experience, with a focus on practical application over theoretical. It speaks to the importance of being able to provide solutions from understanding basic principles of computer science, rather than relying on any specific tools.

## Characteristics of a Pragmatic Programmer

At a high level, a pragmatic programmer will exhibit these qualities:

- **Early adopter/fast adapter**
  - Quick to learn and eager to try new things.
- **Inquisitive**
  - Asks questions, down to the nitty gritty.
- **Critical Thinker**
  - Challenges reasonings and "facts" from others.
- **Realistic**
  - Understands the underlying problem and determines length and difficulty of a task accordingly .
- **Jack of all Trades**
  - Most jobs will require a specialist, but should maintain familiarity with other technologies and environments.

## It's a Continuous Process

- "Kaizen" is a Japanese term that when simplified, is a concept that refers to continuously making small improvements.
  - **Dan's Opinion:** I'm sure this concept is less revolutionary nowadays, especially with the soaring popularity of self-help books like atomic habits that go into detail about these ideas.

## The Cat Ate My Source Code

> "_The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak._" - J.B. Bossuet, _Politics from Holy Writ_, 1709

- When accepting responsibility, you accept being held accountable to its outcome.
- Take responsibility for yourself and your actions in terms of your day-to-day works all the way to career progression.
- Things go wrong. It is important to learn how to deal with these things professionally.

## Software Entropy

- The "Broken Window Theory" explains that a single broken window increases the likelihood of an entire neighborhood ending up tattered and destroyed.
  - **Dan's Opinion:** This lines up with "clean your room" and "tidy your workspace" having a bigger impact on our lives (though I disagree with the second saying).
- If you don't have time to clean up, don't assume someone else will.
- As a challenge, point out two to three "broken windows" to your colleagues and discuss what the problems are and possible actions to fix them.

## Easier to Ask Forgiveness...

> "... than it is to get permission" - Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper

- When you are completely set on an idea, figure out what you can reasonably ask for to get it done, and do it well. Show others. Tell them how it could be improved.
- It is easier to join an ongoing success.

## Good-Enough Software

- The definition of "good enough software" is such that the software is good enough for _users_, eventual maintainers, and your own peace of mind.
- Specifically, a good enough software should meet its user's requirements. So be sure to give users an opportunity to try and determine whether it is good enough (if possible).
- The expected quality of the product should be defined in the requirements collected from the user at the beginning.
- It is also important to know when to stop working on a program or a specific feature. There is such a thing as over-refinement. Put your time to higher value projects.

## Tips

The authors continue to provide basic characteristics of pragmatic programmers in the form of tips.

- **Tip 1**: Care about your craft. Continue to try and improve your work.
- **Tip 2**: Think about what you are working on as you work on it. Every decision requires critical appraisal.
- **Tip 3**: Provide options instead of excuses. When something doesn't work, explain what _can_ be done to fix the problem. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- **Tip 4**: Don't live with broken windows; in our context, fix bad designs and poor code as soon as possible. If it is not possible to entirely fix the issue, take _some_ action to prevent further damage.
- **Tip 5**: Be a catalyst for change.
- **Tip 6**: Remember the big picture. Review what's happening around you and not just on yourself.
- **Tip 7**: Make quality a requirements issue. There will be trade-offs made, so let the users help guide you to a version of the product that is good enough.
