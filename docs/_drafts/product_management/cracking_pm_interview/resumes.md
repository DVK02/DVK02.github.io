# Resumes

## The 15 Second Rule

- A resume screener will glace at resume for about 15 seconds.

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Shorter is Better

- Stick to the highlights, keep out what isn't important.
- Less than 4 years of experience, keep to one page. Over 4 can go 1-2 pages.

### Rule 2: Bullet, Not Blobs

- Easier to read.
- Keep each bullet to less than three lines.
- No more than 50% of bullets should be be over 1 line.
- Edit lines that briefly overflow to next line as they are a waste of space.

### Rule 3: Accomplishments, Not Responsibilities

- Examples
    - Responsibility Oriented: Design features for Amazon S3 and oversee development of the features across software engineers and testers.
    - Accomplishment Oriented: Designed the SS Frontline feature, managed its development, and led its integration across three products, leading to an additional $10 million in revenue.
- Use past tense to better convey an accomplishment rather responsibility.
- Focus on the impact; "what" more so than the "how" (both are important though).
    - How much money did you make for your company? 
    - How much time did you save your team? 
    - By how much did you improve customer retention?
- If you have an existing resume, it might help to start from scratch with these questions in mind:
    - What are the five things you are most proud of?
    - What would your team say are the five most important things you did?

### Rule 4: Use a Good Template

- Don't use one with lots of graphics.
- A good template clearly showcases your highlight.

### Rule 5: Don't Skip the Best Stuff

- Don't leave something out for a reason you think is "appropriate".
    - Example: Starting a game development company, hired multiple engineers and designers, and overseen development of a game - BUT did not include this point becaues it hadn't launched a game yet.
- In short, an experience should not be excluded because it wasn't "done".
- Other reasons include:
    - "It was for class"
    - "We didn't get many downloads"
