# Building Great Products

## The Three Bucket Model

The idea is to categorize features into three buckets:

1. Gamechanger: the reason why someone will buy a product
2. Showstopper: a feature that if missing will lead to loss of sale but wont generate additional sales
3. Distraction: no impact on product sales

## Resource Allocation

- Focus on 1 - 3 gamechanger features, anything more is impossible
- Showstopper features require x amount of work, and no more
- For early releases distractions must be avoided

## Craftsmanship

- Experience in a field will help determine what feature belongs in which bucket and when a bucket is "full"

## Buyers, Stakeholders, Pundits

- Differtiate between feedback from potential users vs those simply commenting
- Evaluate features in buckets based on feedback
- Understand your users and their position and needs

## Aggregate Gamechangers

- Some features are gamechangers in combination with each other
- These are scary as it will require a greater amount of features to be developed in order to have a gamechanger
- Sometimes impossible to avoid, but try if possible

## Product Mission

- Experience and developed intuition may help the prouct manager decide feature prioritization, however to others it is not sufficient to backup decisions based on experience
- Need to always reinforce ideas using data
- A product mission is a way to convince others in a short way that would lead them to make similar prioritiziation decisions

## Make Things as Simple as Possible, but not Simpler

- For example, the iPhone debuted with 4 buttons and a switch; volume up/down, power, home, and mute
    - They identified the highest value actions and only gave physical interface for those
- Having too little interfaces can lead to complexity, as users have to dig through many layers of shallow interfaces to get their desired function
