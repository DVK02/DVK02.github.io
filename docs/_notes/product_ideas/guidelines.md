# Product Guidelines

## Getting Started

1. Write down ideas
2. Go through ideas and start to think more about what to work on
3. Define the problem, before the solution
    - Ask and answer key questions: who am I building it for? why am I building it? What does the MVP look like?
    - Come up with user stories
4. Craft a vision statement; a concise, one line, summary of the product's goal/purpose
5. Make a feature list (includes feature list, user flow, and mockup)
6. Prioritize the feature list
    - Focus on simpler, high value features. Ones that do not require dependant features.
7. Draw the user flow to make sure all components connect
    - If you have sign up, where are you re-directed to after you finish?
    - What about after you log in?
    - If you’re making a content platform, if you finish a piece is there a call to action at the bottom? Where does it go?
8. Make a mockup for each view
    - Informed by feature list and user flow
    - Easy to do on pen and paper
9. Product Specification (optional)
    - Why are we doing it? (high level goals, user scenarios).
    - What are we doing? (feature list)
    - What are any other lasting concerns?
    - Details — mockups, explanations of what to do in error cases, etc.
10. Get feedback
11. Build it!
